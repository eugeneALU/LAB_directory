# TDDD56

The repository contains the documentation and source code of the course - Multicore and GPU Programming(TDDD56).


There are two part of the labs: 
* lab1~lab3 is CPU parts, using Pthreads and SkePU (**skeleton programming**) [webpage][1]
* lab4~lab5 is GPU parts, using CUDA and OpenCL [webpage][2]

## Content

There are six labs:

*  Lab1: The Mandelbrot set and load balancing
*  Lab2: Non-blocking stack
*  Lab3: High-level parallel programming (**SkePU**)
*  Lab4: Introduction to CUDA
*  Lab5: Image filtering with CUDA
*  Lab6: OpenCL Reduction and sorting
